A tiny ladybug named Lucy was flying through the garden when she spotted a beautiful red rose.
She landed on a petal, but the wind suddenly blew, sending her tumbling through the air.
She landed on a leaf, feeling a bit scared, but then a friendly bee buzzed by and helped her back to the rose. Lucy thanked the bee and continued her journey, feeling happy to be back in the sunshine.
